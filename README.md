## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 which is based on the energy consumption of TÃ©touan City. For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in this order:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Random Forest
3. LTSM 
4. XGBoost
5. Core Analysis

## Project's Motivation
Tetouan, is a northern city located in Morrocco and as of the dataset collected in 2017, the country relies heavily on imported oil products while it's population size rose steadily. The study of energy consumption is therefore crucial and improving the energy consumption forecast can therefore help with the following:
- Reduces production costs (excess supply is hard and expensive to store)
- Avoid power shortages
- Ensure energy demands are met

## Problem Definition
1. Which of the models implemented will be better at predicting the energy consumption?
2. Are we able to predict the energy consumption based on a given week?
