## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 which is based on the energy consumption of TÃ©touan City. For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in this order:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Random Forest
3. LTSM 
4. XGBoost
5. Core Analysis

## Project's Motivation
With the heavy reliance on imported oil products and rising population, the study of energy consumption is therefore crucial. 

Improving the energy consumption forecast can help the following:
- Reduces production costs (excess supply is hard and expensive to store)
- Avoid power shortages
- Ensure energy demands are met

## Problem Definition
1. Are we able to predict the energy consumption based on a given week?

2. Which of the models implemented will be better at predicting the energy consumption?
